     * Example:
     * User: class, required in our client
     * UserDto: class, that represents entity, returned from request
     *
     * Reason: sometimes it's easier to use data structure different from
     * structure retrieved from backend
     *
     * So, it's better to have two separate classes, one for data transfer
     * and one for usage in our app
     *
     * Also, other actions could be performed in these methods, including
     * subscribeOn() and observeOn()
     *
     *  fun getUserTrainings(user: User) =
     *      api.getUserTrainings(user.id)
     *          .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
     *          .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
     *          .map {
     *              Training.fromDto(it)
     *          }
